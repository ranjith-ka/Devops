# Skaffold

<https://skaffold.dev/docs/>

Skaffold is a tool that facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes applications.
It can be used to build, test, and deploy applications.

## Skaffold Workflow and Architecture

### Install

```bash
brew install skaffold
```

## skaffold dev

skaffold dev enables continuous local development on an application. While in dev mode, Skaffold will watch an applicationâ€™s source files, and when it detects changes, will rebuild your images (or sync files to your running containers), push any new images, test built images, and redeploy the application to your cluster.

Dev Loop:

- File sync
- build
- Test
- Deploy

Skaffold also supports a polling mode where the filesystem is checked for changes on a configurable interval, or a manual mode, where Skaffold waits for user input to check for file changes. These watch modes can be configured through the --trigger flag.

## Debugging With Skaffold

### TODO

- [ ] Add debugging with Skaffold
- [ ] Steps for Golang and .NET Core
